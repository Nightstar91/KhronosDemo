KHRONOS REPO

Transforming Portal into a Fast-Paced Action Platformer!

General Rule:
1️⃣ Always put your files in your named folder
2️⃣ Within your folder, try to follow proper naming convention for sub folder along with meaningful name for the file itself (for folder name: Material, Scene, Scripts, Art, Models, Texture, Prefab)
3️⃣ (⚠️VERY IMPORTANT⚠️) Do not touch other peoples files! This is to prevent merge conflict when the time to do the pull request. If you absolutely need to modify someone else files, then make a copy of it and place it in your folder and do the modification from there. MAKE NOTE OF IT when making the pull request description!
 
For Branching and Pull Request:
1️⃣ Only branch out when I say the main branch is ready alongside with the posting of the agenda. This is help prevent merge conflict from occurring. (to make sure that main is up to date, look at General Tip; 2)
2️⃣ Follow the deadline of the agenda for making the pull request. Try to have everything ready at least 12 hours before the deadline to make the pull request just in case any issue arise (early submission is appreciated).
3️⃣ COMMUNICATION IS KEY if you have any issue with the pull request. Mistake will happen! The best way to mitigate these problem is to communicate with me so we can come up with the best solution quickly.
4️⃣ When making the description of the pull request, please write at least 3 important contribution that was made (though I don't mind if you need write a longer description)
 
General Tip:
1️⃣ Make the commit description simple and clear.
2️⃣ Make sure the main branch is up to date with FETCH AND PULL
